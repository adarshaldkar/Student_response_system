# Render Deployment Fix for Nodemailer TypeScript Error

## 🐛 **Problem**
Render deployment was failing with TypeScript error:
```
src/services/emailService.ts(1,24): error TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module 'nodemailer'
```

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### 1. **Fixed package.json Structure**
- **MOVED ALL `@types/*` packages to `dependencies`** (Render doesn't install devDependencies properly)
- Kept all TypeScript types as regular dependencies to ensure they're available during build
- This ensures all TypeScript definitions are available during Render deployment

### 2. **Fixed TypeScript Interface Issues**
- Updated `AuthenticatedRequest` interface to properly extend Express `Request`
- Added support for multer file uploads in the interface

### 3. **Updated Build Scripts**
- Changed `render-build` script to use `npm ci` for consistent installs
- This ensures devDependencies are installed during Render build

### 4. **File Changes Made**

#### `package.json`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    // TypeScript types in dependencies for Render
    "@types/express": "^5.0.0",
    "@types/nodemailer": "^7.0.1",
    "@types/node": "^22.10.0",
    "typescript": "^5.7.2",
    // Runtime dependencies
    "express": "^4.19.2",
    "nodemailer": "^7.0.6",
    // ... other packages
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "ts-node-dev": "^2.0.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "render-build": "npm ci && npm run build"
  }
}
```

#### `src/types/nodemailer.d.ts`:
- Fallback TypeScript declarations for nodemailer
- Provides basic type support if package types fail

## 🚀 **Deployment Steps**

1. **Commit Changes to Git:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Add nodemailer types and fix package.json for Render deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Trigger Render Deployment:**
   - Render will automatically detect the new commit
   - Build should now succeed with TypeScript types properly resolved

## 🧪 **Local Testing**
- ✅ Build works locally: `npm run build`
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds
- ✅ All dependencies properly categorized

## 🔧 **Render Build Command**
Make sure Render uses this build command:
```
npm ci && npm run build
```

## ✅ **Why This Solution Works**
- **All TypeScript types are in dependencies**: Render installs them during build
- **Clean TypeScript compilation**: All interfaces properly typed
- **No missing modules**: All required type definitions available

## 📝 **Next Steps After Deployment**
1. Verify forgot password functionality works
2. Test email service (console logs or actual email delivery)
3. Confirm all authentication flows work in production
